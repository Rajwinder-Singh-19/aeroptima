# Aeroptima
OpenMDAO based aerodynamic shape optimization framework. Used for design optimization for the major project on the Aerodynamic Design of a Formula 1 Racing vehicle. Currently in development.

## Progress So Far
1. Shape Parametrization of geometries using cubic bezier splines.
2. Object-Oriented API for shape modeling and analysis of the vast majority of the airfoil shapes available online
3. Easy to use Python-Xfoil interface for quick aerodynamic analysis of airfoil objects.
4. Multiple huge aerodynamic datasets available for machine learning purposes.
5. Surrogate Modeling using Gaussian Progress Regressor and Artificial Neural Networks for quicker optimization runs.
6. General utility scripts for physically realistic sample collection for airfoil shape and aerodynamic data.
